Because we don't know every one of our users personally, we have to put in place some Terms of Service to help keep the ship afloat.</p>\n<p>When we say “Company”, “we”, “our”, or “us”, “Webrockets” in this document, we are referring to Webrockets Sp. z o. o. - our \"limited liability Company\" based in Poland.</p>\n<p>When we say “Services”, we mean any product created and maintained by Webrockets. That includes dazzle.ai whether delivered within a web browser, desktop application, mobile application, or another format.</p>\n<p>When we say “You” or “your”, we are referring to the people or organizations that own an account with one or more of our Services.</p>\n<p>We may update these Terms of Service in the future.</p>\n<p>When you use our Services, now or in the future, you are agreeing to the latest Terms of Service. That's true for any of our existing and future products and all features that we add to our Services over time. There may be times where we do not exercise or enforce any right or provision of the Terms of Service; in doing so, we are not waiving that right or provision. <strong>These terms do contain a limitation of our liability.</strong></p>\n<p>If you violate any of the terms, we may terminate your account. That's a broad statement and it means you need to place a lot of trust in us.</p>\n<h2 id=\"accountterms\">Account Terms</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>You are responsible for maintaining the security of your account and password. The Company cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage from your failure to comply with this security obligation.</li>\n<li>You may not use the Services for any purpose outlined in our <a href=\"/legal/restrictions\">Use Restrictions policy</a>.</li>\n<li>You are responsible for all content posted and activity that occurs under your account. That includes content posted by others who either: (a) have access to your login credentials; or (b) have their own logins under your account.</li>\n<li>You must be a human. Accounts registered by “bots” or other automated methods are not permitted.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"payments\">Payments</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Some functionalities of the Service may require payment.</li>\n<li>You may choose between one time-payment or monthly subscriptions. The prices and differences between subscription plans are described on our <a href=\"/pricing\">webpage</a></li>\n<li>For upgrades or downgrades in plan level, the new rate starts from the next billing cycle. When you upgrade in the middle of monthly subscription you will be charged proportionally to the time left to the end of current subscription term.</li>\n<li>Prices for the Service do include VAT and all applicable local taxes.</li>\n<li>Payment for the Service must be made with credit or debit card. Payments are processed by <a href=\"https://stripe.com\">third party</a> which is certified on accordance with PCI Service Provider Level 1.

We'll try to exempt existing customers from those changes. However, we may choose to change the prices for existing customers. If we do so, we will give at least 7 days notice and will notify you via the email address on record. We may also post a notice about changes on our website.</p></li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"uptimesecurityandprivacy\">Uptime, Security, and Privacy</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Your use of the Services is at your sole risk. We provide these Services on an “as is” and “as available” basis. We do not offer service-level agreements for most of our Services yet — but do take uptime of our applications seriously.</li>\n<li>We reserve the right to temporarily disable your account if your usage significantly exceeds the average usage of other customers of the Services. Of course, we'll reach out to the account owner before taking any action except in rare cases where the level of use may negatively impact the performance of the Service for other customers.</li>\n<li>We take many measures to protect and secure your data through backups, redundancies, and encryption. We enforce encryption for data transmission from the public Internet.</li>\n<li>When you use our Services, you entrust us with your data. We take that trust to heart. You agree that dazzle.ai may process your data as described in our <a href=\"/legal/privacy-policy\">Privacy Policy</a> and for no other purpose.</li>\n<li>We use some third party vendors and hosting partners to provide the necessary hardware, software, networking, storage, and related technology required to run the Services.

However, there is no such thing as a service that pleases everybody. We make no guarantees that our Service will meet your specific requirements or expectations.</p>\n<p>We also test all of our features extensively before shipping them. As with any software, our Service inevitably has some bugs. We track the bugs reported to us and work through priority ones, especially any related to security or privacy. Not all reported bugs will get fixed and we don't guarantee completely error-free Service.</p>\n<h2 id=\"liability\">Liability</h2>\n<p>We mention liability throughout these Terms but to put it all in one section:</p>\n<p><strong><em>You expressly understand and agree that the Company shall not be liable, in law or in equity, to you or to any third party for any direct, indirect, incidental, lost profits, special, consequential, punitive or exemplary damages, including, but not limited to, damages for loss of profits, goodwill, use, data or other intangible losses (even if the Company has been advised of the possibility of such damages), resulting from: (i) the use or the inability to use the Services; (ii) the cost of procurement of substitute goods and services resulting from any goods, data, information or services purchased or obtained or messages received or transactions entered into through or from the Services; (iii) unauthorized access to or alteration of your transmissions or data; (iv) statements or conduct of any third party on the service; (v) or any other matter relating to this Terms of Service or the Services, whether as a breach of contract, tort (including negligence whether active or passive), or any other theory of liability.</em></strong></p>\n<p>If you have a question about any of the Terms of Service, please <a href=\"mailto:dazzleaiapus@gmail.com\">contact our Support team</a>.</p>","title":"","description":"","slug":"terms-of-service"},"__N_SSG":true}
