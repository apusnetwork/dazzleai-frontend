Privacy policy
==============

_Last updated: September 23, 2022_

The privacy of your data - and it is your data, not ours! - is a big deal to us. In this policy, we lay out: what data we collect and why; how your data is handled; and your rights to your data. We promise we never sell your data: never have, never will.

This policy applies to all products built and maintained by Webrockets Sp. z o. o.

What we collect and why
-----------------------

Our guiding principle is to collect only what we need. Her's what that means in practice.

### Identity & access

When you sign up for a Webrockets' product, we typically ask for identifying information such as _your name, email address, and maybe a company name_. That's just so you can personalize your new account, and we can send you invoices, updates, or other essential information. We'll never sell your personal info to third parties, and we won't use your name or company in marketing statements without your permission either.

### Geolocation data

We log all access to all accounts by full IP address so that we can always verify no unauthorized access has happened. We keep this login data for as long as your product account is active.

We also log full IP addresses used to sign up a product account. _We keep this record forever because they are used to mitigate spammy signups._

_Web analytics data - described further in the Website Interactions section - are also tied temporarily to IP addresses to assist with troubleshooting cases._

### Website interactions

When you browse our marketing pages or applications, your browser automatically shares certain information such as which operating system and browser version you are using. We track that information, along with the pages you are visiting, page load timing, and which website referred you for statistical purposes like conversion rates and to test new designs. We sometimes track specific link clicks to help inform some design decisions. _These web analytics data are tied to your IP address and user account if applicable and you are signed into our Services._

### Cookies and Do Not Track

We do use persistent first-party cookies to store certain preferences, make it easier for you to use our applications, and support some in-house analytics. A cookie is a piece of text stored by your browser to help it remember your login information, site preferences, and more. You can adjust cookie retention settings in your own browser. To learn more about cookies, including how to view which cookies have been set and how to manage and delete them, please visit: [www.allaboutcookies.org](https://www.allaboutcookies.org).

_At this time, our sites and applications do not respond to Do Not Track beacons sent by browser plugins._

### Voluntary correspondence

When you write to dazzle.ai with a question or to ask for help, we keep that correspondence, including the email address, so that we have a history of past correspondences to reference if you reach out in the future.

We also store any information you volunteer like surveys. Sometimes when we do customer interviews, we may ask for your permission to record the conversation for future reference or use. We only do so if you give your express consent.

### Information we do not collect

We don't collect any characteristics of protected classifications including age, race, gender, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, or physical and mental abilities or disabilities. You may provide these data voluntarily, such as if you include a pronoun preference in your email signature when writing into our Support team.

When we access or share your information
----------------------------------------

Our default practice is to not access your information. The only times we'll ever access or share your info are:

**To provide products or services you've requested**. We do use some third-party services to run our Services and only to the extent necessary process some or all of your personal information via these third parties. You can view the list of third-party services we use: [subprocessors](/legal/subprocessors).

**To investigate, prevent, or take action regarding [restricted uses](/legal/restrictions).** Accessing a customer's account when investigating potential abuse is a measure of last resort. We have an obligation to protect the privacy and safety of both our customers and the people reporting issues to us. We do our best to balance those responsibilities throughout the process. If we do discover you are using our products for a restricted purpose, we will report the incident to the appropriate authorities.

Your rights with respect to your information
--------------------------------------------

At dazzle.ai, we apply the same data rights to all customers, regardless of their location. Currently some of the most privacy-forward regulations in place are the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation ("GDPR") and California Consumer Privacy Act ("CCPA") in the US. dazzle.ai recognizes all of the rights granted in these regulations, except as limited by applicable law. These rights include:

*   **Right to Know.** You have the right to know what personal information is collected, used, shared or sold. We outline both the categories and specific bits of data we collect, as well as how they are used, in this privacy policy.
*   **Right of Access.** This includes your right to access the personal information we gather about you, and your right to obtain information about the sharing, storage, security and processing of that information.
*   **Right to Correction.** You have the right to request correction of your personal information.
*   **Right to Erasure / "To be Forgotten".** This is your right to request, subject to certain limitations under applicable law, that your personal information be erased from our possession and, by extension, all of our service providers. Fulfillment of some data deletion requests may prevent you from using dazzle.ai services because our applications may then no longer work. In such cases, a data deletion request may result in closing your account.
*   **Right to Complain.** You have the right to make a complaint regarding our handling of your personal information with the appropriate supervisory authority. To identify your specific authority or find out more about this right, EU individuals should go to [https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/board/members\_en](https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/board/members_en).
*   **Right to Restrict Processing.** This is your right to request restriction of how and why your personal information is used or processed, including opting out of sale of personal information. (Again: we never have and never will sell your personal data.)
*   **Right to Object.** You have the right, in certain situations, to object to how or why your personal information is processed.
*   **Right to Portability.** You have the right to receive the personal information we have about you and the right to transmit it to another party.
*   **Right to not be subject to Automated Decision-Making.** You have the right to object and prevent any decision that could have a legal, or similarly significant, effect on you from being made solely based on automated processes. This right is limited, however, if the decision is necessary for performance of any contract between you and us, is allowed by applicable law, or is based on your explicit consent.
*   **Right to Non-Discrimination.** This right stems from the CCPA. We do not and will not charge you a different amount to use our products, offer you different discounts, or give you a lower level of customer service because you have exercised your data privacy rights. However, the exercise of certain rights (such as the right "to be forgotten") may, by virtue of your exercising those rights, prevent you from using our Services.

Many of these rights can be exercised by signing in and directly updating your account information.

_If you have questions about exercising these rights or need assistance, please contact us at [dazzleaiapus@gmail.com](mailto:dazzleaiapus@gmail.com) or at Webrockets Sp. z o. o. Okopowa 47a/40, 01-059 Warsaw, Poland. For requests to delete personal information or know what personal information has been collected, we will first verify your identity using a combination of at least two pieces of information already collected including your user email address. If an authorized agent is corresponding on your behalf, we will first need written consent with a signature from the account holder before proceeding._

If you are in the EU, you can identify your specific authority to file a complaint or find out more about GDPR, at [https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/board/members\_en](https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/board/members_en).

How we secure your data
-----------------------

_All data is encrypted via [SSL/TLS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security) when transmitted from our servers to your browser. The database backups are also encrypted._

_Most data are not encrypted while they live in our database (since it needs to be ready to send to you when you need it), but we go to great lengths to secure your data at rest._

Changes & questions
-------------------

We may update this policy as needed to comply with relevant regulations and reflect any new practices.
